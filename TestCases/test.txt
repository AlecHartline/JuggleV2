# hashes make comment blocks! Comment blocks must terminate with a semicolon
See? This isn't even parsed! I can write 8-3 without the interpreter yelling
at me! Now I'm going to stop and make a semicolon;

{/announce=true,debug=false};
label{Hello};
(2 ^ :n:){o}{p};
:n: + 1 = :n:;
{i};
goto{Hello};
